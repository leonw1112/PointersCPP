# C++ Pointer Examples

This is a simple C++ program that contains three functions to demonstrate the use of pointers. You can use this program to learn more about pointers in C++.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed that supports the `iostream` header file.

2. Clone this repository to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leonw1112/PointersCPP``
3. Change to the directory of the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd PointersCPP```
4. Compile the program using your C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o pointer_examples`
5. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./pointer_examples``
## Usage

The program contains three main functions:

#### PointersToInt

This function demonstrates how to create a pointer to an integer variable and change the value of that variable using the pointer.

#### PointersToChar

This function shows how to work with pointers to strings and prints the text in reverse order.

#### DynamicArray
This function demonstrates how to create a Dynamic memory allocation with pointers.

To run the program:

1. ```bash
   ./pointer.examples```

2. Follow the instructions displayed by the program to perform the respective task.

## User Guide

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the program by running the compiled binary.

2. **Task Selection**: When prompted, enter one of the following options:

   - `h`: Display a brief description of the available tasks.
   - `1`: Call the `PointersToInt` function to demonstrate pointers to integers.
   - `2`: Call the `PointersToChar` function to demonstrate pointers to strings.
   - `3`: Call the `DynamicArray` function to demonstrate Dynamic memory allocation.

3. **Follow Instructions**: Follow the instructions provided by the program to complete the selected task.

   - For Task 1 (Pointers to Integers): You will be prompted to enter a number, and the program will demonstrate how to use a pointer to change the value of that number.

   - For Task 2 (Pointers to Strings): The program will reverse and display a sample string.
  
   - For Task 3 (Dynamic memory allocation): The program will save an user-given array of numbers for you using pointers.

4. **Explore and Learn**: Use this program as a learning tool to understand how pointers work in C++.
